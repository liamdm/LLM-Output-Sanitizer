# LLM-Output-Sanitizer
A zero-install bookmarklet for cleaning LLM-generated text.  LLMs frequently emit annoying smart punctuation, invisible Unicode, emoji joiners, and typographic symbols (because they couldn't crack fingerprinting apparently). This tool normalizes that output into predictable ASCII in one click, directly in your browser.
